Task scheduling in cloud computing is an important aspect for improving resource allocation and improving overall system performance to provide the user with a seamless experience. Various metaheuristic algorithms have been researched for addressing this problem, each offers a unique approach to finding near-optimal solution.Classical scheduling methods often fail to meet the targets due to fluctuating workloads and availability of resources. Therefore there is a need for scheduling algorithms that can accommodate altered conditions and enhance system performance. Various metaheuristic algorithms, including Ant Colony Optimization(ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a Heuristic method for task scheduling in cloud computing. The analysis of these algorithms' performance in terms of execution time, and resource utilization provide insights into the strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm, providing practical assistance for picking the best technique for work scheduling in cloud environments.
